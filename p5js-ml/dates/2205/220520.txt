Prelim optimizers investigation - tf_xor script, test epochs on same sequential kernel weights.
  separate tf.sequential instances cannot be used for comparison
  the kernel weights must be the same for consistent test
  Literature demonstates SGD use as common
  initial observation shows a threshold for loss = 0.000001 is consistent among optimisers
  depends on the initial weights for initial descent and saddle stuckness
  epochs relevance requires model.save
